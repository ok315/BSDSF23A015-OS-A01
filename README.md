# BSDSF23A015-OS-A01

This repository contains my Operating Systems assignment 1, where I create a core C utilities library named **libmyutils**. The project demonstrates modular programming, static and dynamic libraries, build automation with Makefile, documentation, and version control using Git.

## Project Structure

- `src/` - Source code files
- `include/` - Header files
- `lib/` - Compiled libraries (static and dynamic)
- `bin/` - Executables
- `obj/` - Object files
- `REPORT.md` - Analysis and reflections

## How to build and run

(You can fill this later after writing the Makefile and programs)

Feel free to update this file as the project progresses.
