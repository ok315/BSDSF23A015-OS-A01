# Assignment 1 - Core C Utilities Library

## Project Setup

- Created a GitHub repository with the required naming convention.
- Initialized project folders (`src`, `include`, `lib`, `bin`, `obj`) to organize code and build artifacts.
- Set up version control with Git and pushed initial commits.
- Added placeholder `.gitkeep` files to track empty directories.

## Next Steps

- Implement string and file utility functions in C.
- Write a Makefile to automate building the library and main program.
- Document functions using Linux man pages.
- Explore static and dynamic linking.
- Analyze binaries using Linux tools.
- Maintain a clean Git workflow with branching and tagging.
